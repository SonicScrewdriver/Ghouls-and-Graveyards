THE GHOST'S TURN:
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
• The ghost, once awakened, moves one space after 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   the player's turn is complete.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
• The ghost is invisible. It always moves directly toward
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   the player (exception: if you're in your base during the
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   ghost's move, it retreats toward the treasure). It can
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   move diagonally, and ignores all walls.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
• If the ghost catches you while you're on your home
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   base, nothing happens.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
• If the ghost catches you while you're empty-handed, 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   or you're in the treasure room, you lose a life and
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   return to your home base.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
• If the ghost catches you while you're carrying
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   the treasure—outside of the treasure room—the game
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
   ends immediately!
